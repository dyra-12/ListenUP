<h1>ListenUP : Empowering the Visually Impaired with an Accessible News Reader</h1>

<h2> Problem Statement:</h2>
<br>
Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges accessing news content due to the heavy 
reliance on visual elements in traditional platforms and the limitations of existing solutions like braille-based 
newspapers and audio recordings. Digital news platforms often lack inclusive accessibility features, 
making it difficult for visually impaired individuals to navigate and comprehend news articles. 
There is a pressing need for an accessible news reader that empowers visually impaired individuals 
by providing timely, customizable, and comprehensible news content, enabling them to stay informed 
and engage with the world around them.
